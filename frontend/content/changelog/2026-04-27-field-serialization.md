Implements Issue #18.

- `FQ_MODULUS` constant (BN254 base field prime p) added to `Bn254`.
- `fr_to_bytes` / `fr_from_bytes` with strict range check against r.
- `fq_to_bytes` / `fq_from_bytes` with strict range check against p.
- 13 tests: round-trip identity, boundary values, rejection of inputs ≥ modulus.
- No heap allocation — fixed `[u8; 32]` arrays, snarkjs/circom big-endian compatible.
