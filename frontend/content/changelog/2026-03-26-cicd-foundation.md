Establishes the CI/CD foundation for the project:

- GitHub Actions workflow with `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`, and Miri UB checks.
- WASM size guards ensuring guest binaries stay within Soroban limits.
- `ZkEnv` trait architecture separating host-environment concerns from pure cryptographic logic.
- `deny.toml` for license compliance (Apache-2.0 / MIT).
