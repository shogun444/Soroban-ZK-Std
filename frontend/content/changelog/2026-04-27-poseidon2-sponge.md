Implements Issue #2. Poseidon2 sponge over BN254 Fr (t=3, rate=2, capacity=1):

- Calls `env.crypto_hazmat().poseidon2_permutation()` — one host call per permutation, zero guest-side loop overhead.
- `hash_to_field()` compatible with Noir/Circom Poseidon2 constraints.
- KAT verified against `soroban-env-host-25.0.1`.
